**Prompt original do criador:**

````text
Create a 15s motion-graphics film explaining {{PRODUCT}}. HyperFrames + GSAP, no voiceover, no footage.
Style: paper-light canvas, marker notes that draw on, real physics, huge kinetic type,
hard light/dark switches, a new idea every 1.5–2 s, a sound on every hit.

COPY: read {{POSITIONING_DOCS}} first. {{ONE_LINER}} For {{AUDIENCE}}. {{WHAT_IT_DOES}}
Name what the product learns, never the abstraction.

RULES
- No chrome (scrubber, timecode, fps, headers). No animator jargon on screen
  ("squash", "stagger", "easing"...). Every word speaks to the buyer.
- No invented results: no %, multipliers, customer names or figures.
- Never use: {{BANNED_WORDS}}.
- Logo: real mark {{LOGO_FILE}} + "{{PRODUCT}}" in {{WORDMARK_FONT}}; never a boxed logo file.

CRAFT
- Colours {{COLOR_CANVAS}} / {{COLOR_INK}} / {{COLOR_ACCENT_1}} / {{COLOR_ACCENT_2}}; notes in the
  accents; dark mode = charcoal matching the palette.
- Fonts {{BRAND_FONTS}}; Anton for kinetic type; Caveat handwriting via stroke-dashoffset.
- Real easing, squash/stretch, stagger, overlap, onion skin, smear, follow-through. Check the
  HyperFrames registry first. Set every from-state at t=0 (seek-safe); never cover an exit.
  One primary move per transition; no generic push/slide/rotate-swing.
- Music in sections: drums drop on the dark switch and while the ball is airborne, slam back
  on the type and the logo. SFX: pops, pen scribbles, whooshes, logo sub-hit. CC0 or generated
  only; log sources. Master -14 LUFS, -2 dBTP, re-measured after AAC encode.Show allThis prompt was taken directly from @ik_builds’s post (opens in a new tab).ModelOpus 5.5EffortMediumIterationsOne-shotStackHyperFrames + GSAPPostedSep 26, 2026

### Studio1 intro showreel

**Prompt original do criador:**

````text
make a dynamic 15-second motion graphics video that shows what an incredible work Studio1 is doing, you will get relevant info from case study, create like it's a good showreel for a Studio1 intro launch. go all out.

**Versão completa (estruturada a partir do original):**

````text
<inputs>
Ask me for anything below I haven't given you. If I skip it, use the default: 3 to 6 screenshots of the real interface (default: capture them yourself), the logo (default: take it from the site), brand colors and font (default: its own colors and typeface), and a royalty-free track with a clear beat (default: compose one in code).
</inputs>

<direction>
A 15-second intro showreel for Studio1. Research it first: what it does, who it's for, its real interface and its brand. Use what you find; never invent screens, features or numbers.
Focus on the work Studio1 does, from its case study.
Pick one through-line object from the product itself (its cursor, a key button, the logo's mark, a single data point) and make every scene a transformation of it: it starts in the UI, changes shape or role in each scene, and becomes the logo on the end card. Name it before you storyboard.
Rebuild the real UI as vector layers so its parts can move on their own; never slide a flat screenshot in. A cursor drives every interaction with real clicks and drags, and the camera zooms screen-studio style so each moment fills the frame.
Brand: its own colors and typeface. One typeface, one accent color used only on the through-line object and the key word, lots of empty space. Get the facts from the case study I give you.
Motion rules: springs with at most a small overshoot; nothing appears from nothing (it grows, unfolds or is revealed by a mask); the camera never sits still (push from 1.0 to 1.04 across a scene, and start each scene at the zoom the last one ended on); something changes on every beat.
Banned: particle bursts, glows, lens flares, camera shake, RGB split, crossfades, generic gradients, bouncy easing, holds longer than half a second, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
120 BPM. Write a timed storyboard first, beat by beat, then build exactly that.
Hook (first bar): the problem in three to five words, in big type that the through-line object interrupts.
Middle: three or four moments of the product doing what it does best. Each begins with the through-line object turning into the next UI element and lands one readable idea.
Payoff (last bars): the strongest moment on the biggest beat, then the through-line object becomes the logo and the end card: the name and a one-line call to action.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file at 1920x1080. Every style is computed from time inside window.seek(t): no CSS animations, no timers, no state carried between frames.
2. Use spring and exponential easing written as functions of time. Blur follows speed and direction on fast moves.
3. Write a soundtrack in code with the Web Audio API (OfflineAudioContext): a kick on every beat and a hit on each scene change. Render it to WAV.
4. Render with Playwright at 60fps, 3 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix for motion blur, then mux the audio.
5. Before the full render, render one frame per beat and look at them. Fix anything cluttered, off the beat, overlapping or hard to read.
</build>

<gotchas>
Measure element positions at runtime for match cuts instead of hard-coding them. When a shape fills the frame, scale it past all four corners. Give outgoing and incoming text separate timing so letters never overlap. Never put will-change on anything the camera scales, or text renders blurry.
</gotchas>

<start>
Show me what you found, the through-line object and a beat-by-beat storyboard, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the final MP4.

**Versão completa (estruturada a partir do original):**

````text
<direction>
A 20-second motion design showreel that proves you are a world-class motion designer, built around mathematics: shapes, proofs and patterns you'd find in a math book. Pick one visual concept from it and commit to it: name it in one line before you start. Every shot is made out of the previous one: shapes, type and color transform into the next scene instead of cutting or fading.
One typeface, a palette of at most three colors plus black and white, one consistent camera language.
Show range: kinetic type, shape morphing, a 2D-to-3D moment, a data or UI moment, and an end title. Give each one an equal share of the time.
Banned: particle bursts, glows, lens flares, camera shake, RGB split, crossfades, generic gradients, bouncy easing, holds longer than half a second, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
120 BPM, something happens on every beat.
First bar: hook. Then one technique per bar, each flowing out of the last. Last full bar: the strongest moment. Final half bar: end title, and the final frame matches the first so it loops.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file at 1920x1080. Every style is computed from time inside window.seek(t): no CSS animations, no timers, no state carried between frames.
2. Use spring and exponential easing written as functions of time. Blur follows speed and direction on fast moves.
3. Write a soundtrack in code with the Web Audio API (OfflineAudioContext): a kick on every beat, a riser into the last full bar, a hit on each scene change. Render it to WAV.
4. Render with Playwright at 60fps, 3 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix for motion blur, then mux the audio.
5. Before the full render, render one frame per beat and look at them. Fix anything cluttered, off the beat, overlapping or hard to read.

### Token bucket rate limiter

**Prompt original do criador:**

````text
explain a token bucket rate limiter, canvas only, no libraries, every frame a pure function of time so my renderer can screenshot it.
````

**Versão completa (estruturada a partir do original):**

````text
<direction>
A 45-second explainer on how a token bucket rate limiter works for a developer.
Build the whole explanation as one diagram in one continuous space: the camera zooms into a part to explain it and pulls back to show how it fits, so the viewer always knows where they are. Every idea gets a picture before it gets words, and labels sit on the thing they name, never in a legend.
Style: a clean canvas diagram: the bucket, tokens dripping in, requests taking them. Canvas only, no libraries, every frame a pure function of time so a renderer can screenshot it.
Motion rules: one thing moves at a time, and the eye always knows where to look; arrows and flows animate in the direction things actually move; no more than seven words on screen at once, held for at least 0.3 seconds a word.
Banned: walls of text, bullet lists, generic gradients, stock-looking icons, glows, crossfades, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
Write a timed storyboard first, then build exactly that.
Hook: a question the viewer already has, asked over the first picture.
Middle: three to five steps. Each zooms into one part of the diagram, shows one concrete example, then pulls back as that part locks into place.
Payoff: a final pull back to the whole diagram, now complete, and a one-line takeaway.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file at 1080x1080. Every style is computed from time inside window.seek(t): no CSS animations, no timers, no state carried between frames.
2. Use spring and exponential easing written as functions of time. Blur follows speed and direction on fast moves.
3. Write a soundtrack in code with the Web Audio API (OfflineAudioContext): a soft pulse under each step and a hit as each idea lands. Render it to WAV.
4. Render with Playwright at 60fps, 3 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix for motion blur, then mux the audio.
5. Before the full render, render one frame per beat and look at them. Fix anything cluttered, off the beat, overlapping or hard to read.
</build>

<gotchas>
Check every number and name against a source. Keep the diagram's layout fixed so zooming in and out never reshuffles it. Give outgoing and incoming text separate timing so letters never overlap.

Show me the steps, the diagram and a timed storyboard, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the final MP4.

**Prompt original do criador:**

````text
Add a good fast royalty free music to this video, and make 2 versions - 1 landscape, and another portrait
````

**Versão completa (estruturada a partir do original):**

````text
<direction>
Add music to the video I attach: a good, fast track, royalty-free with a license that allows social media.
Then make two versions: 1920x1080 landscape and 1080x1920 portrait, recomposing each frame for its shape rather than cropping blindly, so the important part is always in view.
</direction>

<structure>
Cut the music so it starts and ends with the video, with big moments landing on the beat.
</structure>

<build>
1. Find the beat grid of the music and nudge cuts to it where it helps.
2. Duck the music under any speech. Loudnorm to -14 LUFS.
3. Export each version with ffmpeg and watch each one through.
</build>

<start>
Tell me the track you picked and its license, then make the versions without asking me anything else.

### DeFi Saver stop-motion explainer
`nikolajankovic-ce4ff4` · @_nikolajankovic · 2026-09-23 · 15 palavras · tags: Gráficos, Diagramas

**Prompt original do criador:**

````text
make a hand-drawn stop-motion animation;
story: you're defi saver and explaining yourself in 1st person
````

**Versão completa (estruturada a partir do original):**

````text
<direction>
A 45-second animated short film: DeFi Saver explains itself in the first person: what it is, what it does for you, why you'd want it.
Style: hand-drawn stop-motion: paper textures, pencil lines that boil from frame to frame, 12 frames per second. Build it entirely in code.
Write the story first. Give the main character one clear want, three attempts that fail in different and escalating ways, a turn, and an ending that lands, plus a last-second gag after it.
Acting: every character reads in silhouette; every action has anticipation before it and follow-through after it; squash and stretch on anything soft; the eyes move first and the body follows; hold key poses for at least six frames.
Staging: one action per shot, framed so it reads instantly. Cut on action, matching the movement across the cut. Let the color shift with the mood.
Sound: a warm narration in the first person, with paper and pencil sounds. Sound should tell half the story.
Banned: glows, lens flares, generic gradients, anything that looks like stock clip art, everything moving at once.
</direction>

<structure>
Write a shot list first, one action per shot, with timings, then build exactly that. Shots join through motion and sound, never crossfades.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file at 1920x1080. Every style is computed from time inside window.seek(t): no CSS animations, no timers, no state carried between frames.
2. Use spring and exponential easing written as functions of time. Blur follows speed and direction on fast moves.
3. Write a soundtrack in code with the Web Audio API (OfflineAudioContext): the film's sound, timed to the shot list. Render it to WAV.
4. Render with Playwright at 60fps, 3 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix for motion blur, then mux the audio.
5. Before the full render, render one frame per beat and look at them. Fix anything cluttered, off the beat, overlapping or hard to read.
</build>

<gotchas>
Lock feet and hands where they touch things, so contacts never slide. Keep the character's proportions the same in every shot. Give each gag a beat of stillness before it lands.
</gotchas>

<start>
Show me the story in a few lines and the shot list, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the final MP4.

### Moroccan political history timeline
`triglyceee-bd5b08` · @TrigLyceee · 2026-09-26 · A few rounds · 11 palavras · tags: Gráficos, Tipografia cinética

**Prompt original do criador:**

````text
réalise une vidéo résumant la vie politique au Maroc depuis l’indépendance
````

**Versão completa (estruturada a partir do original):**

````text
<direction>
A 3-minute explainer on political life in Morocco since independence for a general audience. Research it first and keep every fact right; never invent numbers or quotes.
Build the whole explanation as one diagram in one continuous space: the camera zooms into a part to explain it and pulls back to show how it fits, so the viewer always knows where they are. Every idea gets a picture before it gets words, and labels sit on the thing they name, never in a legend.
Style: an editorial timeline with maps and archival photos where the license allows. Narrate it with a clear synthesized voice in French (e.g. edge-tts fr-FR-DeniseNeural), with subtitles synced line by line.
Motion rules: one thing moves at a time, and the eye always knows where to look; arrows and flows animate in the direction things actually move; no more than seven words on screen at once, held for at least 0.3 seconds a word.
Banned: walls of text, bullet lists, generic gradients, stock-looking icons, glows, crossfades, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
Write a timed storyboard first, then build exactly that.
Hook: a question the viewer already has, asked over the first picture.
Middle: three to five steps. Each zooms into one part of the diagram, shows one concrete example, then pulls back as that part locks into place.
Payoff: a final pull back to the whole diagram, now complete, and a one-line takeaway.
</structure>

<build>
1. Write the narration script first, line by line, marking what's on screen for each line.
2. Generate each line with a clear synthesized voice in French (e.g. edge-tts fr-FR-DeniseNeural) and time the animation to each line's real audio length.
3. One HTML file at 1920x1080. Every style is computed from time inside window.seek(t): no CSS animations, no timers, no state carried between frames.
4. Render with Playwright at 60fps, 3 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix for motion blur, then mux in the narration, quiet music under it and subtitles.
5. Before the full render, export a key frame from each section and check it. Fix anything crowded, overlapping or hard to read.
</build>

<gotchas>
Check every number and name against a source. Keep the diagram's layout fixed so zooming in and out never reshuffles it. Give outgoing and incoming text separate timing so letters never overlap.

### Oscilloscope-style studio motion graphic
`rneayan-ea6129` · @rneayan · 2026-09-25 · 8 palavras · tags: Gráficos, Tipografia cinética

**Prompt original do criador:**

````text
Make Motiongraphic about my studio with Oscilloscope style
````

**Versão completa (estruturada a partir do original):**

````text
<inputs>
Ask me for anything below I haven't given you. If I skip it, use the default: 3 to 6 screenshots of the real interface (default: capture them yourself), the logo (default: take it from the site), brand colors and font (default: an oscilloscope look: green phosphor lines on black, traces that glow and decay), and a royalty-free track with a clear beat (default: compose one in code).
</inputs>

<direction>
A 20-second studio film for my studio. Use the live site's real assets (logo, screenshots, copy) wherever they fit. Never invent features or numbers.
Pick one through-line object from the product itself (its cursor, a key button, the logo's mark, a single data point) and make every scene a transformation of it: it starts in the UI, changes shape or role in each scene, and becomes the logo on the end card. Name it before you storyboard.
Rebuild the real UI as vector layers so its parts can move on their own; never slide a flat screenshot in. A cursor drives every interaction with real clicks and drags, and the camera zooms screen-studio style so each moment fills the frame.
Brand: an oscilloscope look: green phosphor lines on black, traces that glow and decay. One typeface, one accent color used only on the through-line object and the key word, lots of empty space. Everything drawn as oscilloscope traces.
Motion rules: springs with at most a small overshoot; nothing appears from nothing (it grows, unfolds or is revealed by a mask); the camera never sits still (push from 1.0 to 1.04 across a scene, and start each scene at the zoom the last one ended on); something changes on every beat.
Banned: particle bursts, glows, lens flares, camera shake, RGB split, crossfades, generic gradients, bouncy easing, holds longer than half a second, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
120 BPM. Write a timed storyboard first, beat by beat, then build exactly that.
Hook (first bar): the problem in three to five words, in big type that the through-line object interrupts.
Middle: three or four moments of the product doing what it does best. Each begins with the through-line object turning into the next UI element and lands one readable idea.
Payoff (last bars): the strongest moment on the biggest beat, then the through-line object becomes the logo and the end card: the name and a one-line call to action.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file at 1920x1080. Every style is computed from time inside window.seek(t): no CSS animations, no timers, no state carried between frames.
2. Use spring and exponential easing written as functions of time. Blur follows speed and direction on fast moves.
3. Write a soundtrack in code with the Web Audio API (OfflineAudioContext): a kick on every beat and a hit on each scene change. Render it to WAV.
4. Render with Playwright at 60fps, 3 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix for motion blur, then mux the audio.
5. Before the full render, render one frame per beat and look at them. Fix anything cluttered, off the beat, overlapping or hard to read.
</build>

<gotchas>
Measure element positions at runtime for match cuts instead of hard-coding them. When a shape fills the frame, scale it past all four corners. Give outgoing and incoming text separate timing so letters never overlap. Never put will-change on anything the camera scales, or text renders blurry.
</gotchas>

<start>
Show me what you found, the through-line object and a beat-by-beat storyboard, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the final MP4.

**Prompt original do criador:**

````text
请用Manim给我制作一个导数概念学习的视频，要求通俗易懂，并且有例子，引人思考。配音使用edge-tts
````

**Versão completa (estruturada a partir do original):**

````text
<direction>
Use Manim to make a 3-minute lesson on the derivative for complete beginners. Make it easy to understand, with concrete examples, and make people think.
Start from an everyday question that leads to the idea, build intuition step by step, and only then give the formal definition and formula. Every new idea gets something on screen: a graph, an animation, a color that tracks it.
Narrate it in Chinese with edge-tts (zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural), with subtitles synced line by line.
Banned: long blocks of static text, formulas piled up without animation, music louder than the voice.
</direction>

<structure>
The question, the intuition, two or three examples from easy to harder, the formal definition, and a question for the viewer to think about at the end.
</structure>

<build>
1. Write the narration script first, line by line, marking what's on screen for each line.
2. Generate each line with edge-tts and time the Manim animations to each line's real audio length.
3. Render with Manim at 1920x1080, 60fps, and mux in the narration and subtitles.
4. Before the full render, export a key frame from each section and check it. Fix anything crowded, overlapping or hard to read.
</build>

<start>
Show me the script and a storyboard, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the final MP4.
